**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This project was built during a 5-day AI & Computer Vision Bootcamp, guiding participants through the process of building a complete image recognition model in Python using deep learning. By the end, the system could successfully classify images — I.E, identifying whether a photo contained a cat or a dog.

**What This Project Covers**
Image Preprocessing & Augmentation — resizing, normalization, and visualization of image datasets (MNIST, Cats vs. Dogs).

Deep Learning Fundamentals — understanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their role in image recognition.

Model Training & Evaluation — tracking accuracy and loss, calculating precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizing with confusion matrices.

Transfer Learning — fine-tuning pre-trained architectures like MobileNetV2 for improved performance.

Project Deployment & Documentation — preparing a professional GitHub repository with code, results, and visualizations.
